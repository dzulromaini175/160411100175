"b'\n\t\t\t\t\tHere\xe2\x80\x99s Everything You Need To Know About \xe2\x80\x98Break Her,\xe2\x80\x99 The New Game You\xe2\x80\x99ll Wish You Never Heard\xc2\xa0Of\t\t\t\t'","You know the kind of girl I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. She looks like life chewed her up and spit her back out. You can see it in her eyes if you could even see her eyes. Her loose, tangled hair covers most of her face, and she\xe2\x80\x99s always staring at her feet. You can see it in her hunched shoulders, hear it in her mumbling voice. She\xe2\x80\x99s both desperate and afraid to be heard, hating herself for everything she says and everything she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live in my building, but I see her almost every day when she visits her boyfriend in the apartment next door. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said hello to her a few times \xe2\x80\x94 she always flinches when I talk to her. The first thing out of her mouth is inevitably an apology \xe2\x80\x94 sorry for being in my way, or for being here too often, or for taking up one of the dozen empty parking spots. I asked her name once, but she said it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? What am I supposed to say when I see you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to. I\xe2\x80\x99m nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell my name is \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But she just kept walking. Head leaning against my neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s door, hands in her pockets, looking like an ostrich trying to disappear into the sand. \xe2\x80\x9cBye nobody!\xe2\x80\x9d I chimed as the door opened to let her in. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sure under the hair, but I think she almost smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cBye somebody,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, disappearing into the doorway. My neighbor Jeff poked his head out \xe2\x80\x94 a scrawny fellow with a soul patch and a beanie which seemed permanently fixed to his head. He nodded sharply at me like a fighter paying insincere respect to his opponent, slamming the door. I liked watching Nobody from my balcony when she was parking her car. I liked the fluid grace of her movements which transformed regular motions like opening doors and stepping over obstacles into a choreographed dance. I must not have been the only one to notice either because there always seemed to be someone hitting on her whenever I saw her. Not the charming kind either \xe2\x80\x94 fat oafs jumping out of their car like they were waiting for her, or pushy street rats backing her up against the building. I thought she was a prostitute at first, but she always rebuffed them so vehemently that I figured that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case. Often at night, I\xe2\x80\x99d see her leaning on the railing of my neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s balcony, smoking a joint and staring off into space. I got the feeling that she was staring into a world that only she could see, but looking at her face, I also got the feeling that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a very pretty world. I wish I could see it too. Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99d go out onto my own balcony and try to make an excuse for conversation, but she\xe2\x80\x99d invariably duck back inside the moment she saw me. If I was lucky and she seemed to be in good spirits, I\xe2\x80\x99d hear a \xe2\x80\x9cBye somebody\xe2\x80\x9d before she went. A stupid joke, but it always made me smile. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been happy, but I suppose it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any of my business. I\xe2\x80\x99d hear her boyfriend yelling at her through the walls sometimes, although I never heard her say anything back. I figured that she was her own person with her own choices to make, and if she was being really mistreated, then she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep coming back. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I had proof that she was being abused or anything \xe2\x80\x94 and what I did guess, I quickly dismissed as petty jealousy, resolving not to interfere with her life. That resolution lasted for about two months, but it ended last night. It was after dark and I was getting home late when I spotted Nobody pressed up against my building. Two men in leather jackets were several inches too close for innocent conversation, practically pressing themselves on her while she squirmed to get away. I honked my car horn at them, and one looked over his shoulder. Fat stupid face, mouth hanging part way open, he stared at me for a few seconds before turning back to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI got to go,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard her say. \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody is waiting for me.\xe2\x80\x9d I honked again. Fat-face turned to walk over to my car. \xe2\x80\x9cCool it, asshole,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cThis target only has 11 points left anyway. Get your own damn girl.\xe2\x80\x9d I rolled down my window. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that supposed to mean?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou new or something?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, fishing out his phone. He showed me the screen which depicted a GPS map of my neighborhood. Scattered throughout were little targets, each with a name and a life-bar like a video game character has. The target against my building was named \xe2\x80\x98Cillia\xe2\x80\x99 with 11/100 life remaining. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the fuck that is, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not playing,\xe2\x80\x9d I told him. He laughed. More like a guffaw really \xe2\x80\x94 deep and guttural without the slightest hint of mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re after that piece of shit and you\xe2\x80\x99re not even getting points? Hey Mark \xe2\x80\x94 he actually wants this bitch.\xe2\x80\x9d The other guy \xe2\x80\x94 presumably Mark \xe2\x80\x94 still had the girl against the wall. He made a half-lunge at her as she wriggled free, but it was just to scare her. She looked like she was about to run toward my car, but seeing the fat one over by me, she sprinted to her own vehicle instead. We all watched as she tore out of the parking lot, the biggest smile I\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen plastered across her face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time. Somebody already broke her.\xe2\x80\x9d Fat-face slammed my car with the palm of his hand as he turned to leave. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go, Mark. There\xe2\x80\x99s two more of them on this street.\xe2\x80\x9d I was so relieved to see them go that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to ask more questions. Nobody had a name. It was Cillia. And something was tracking her location and broadcasting it out to these creeps. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I was meddling in someone else\xe2\x80\x99s business anymore. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just play dumb and let her sort this out for herself. A few minutes later and I was hammering on my neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. \xe2\x80\x9cHey Jeff, you in there?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBug off,\xe2\x80\x9d came the muffled reply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about the game you\xe2\x80\x99re playing with Cillia.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed pretty vague to me, but if he was involved then he\xe2\x80\x99d know what I was talking about. Loud shuffling like someone crossing the room in a hurry and the door opened a moment later. He was wearing nothing but his boxers and his beanie, skinny body blocking the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, what about the game?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. I hesitated, unsure what to say next. He must have misread my silence because his face became animated and hopeful. \xe2\x80\x9cHey did I win the prize or something?\xe2\x80\x9d I nodded stiffly. Jeff threw the door open to welcome me in, practically dancing with excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cHoly shit I knew it! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the leader-board for weeks \xe2\x80\x94 it was only a matter of time. Seriously competitive shit, you know? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got everything ready for you, come on in.\xe2\x80\x9d He rushed to a cabinet under the sink and began hauling out cardboard boxes. I still didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the hell was going on though, so I had to play along to get more answers. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many points are you at now?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9c723,\xe2\x80\x9d without hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9c19 separate targets, although I\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting most of the points from Cillia, as you know.\xe2\x80\x9d He plopped two cardboard boxes on the coffee table beside me, flaying them open for inspection. The greasy smell of stale sex was nauseating. \xe2\x80\x9cThis one\xe2\x80\x99s got all the condoms in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Hundreds of them \xe2\x80\x94 all used \xe2\x80\x94 neatly tied off into little balloons. \xe2\x80\x9cThen this one has all the recordings.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c723 is a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, pretending to be impressed. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me how you were keeping score.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked suspicious for a moment, but it passed. If my question raised any red flags, then he was so pleased with himself that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t dwell on it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s legit, I swear. I used the \xe2\x80\x98Break Her\xe2\x80\x99 rulebook and everything. 10 points for humiliating her. 15 points for taking a personal item or making a big decision for her. 25 for unwanted sex or something physical. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bunch of the small ones I\xe2\x80\x99ve been building up \xe2\x80\x94 the daily criticisms, isolating her from friends and family, that sort of thing. What\xe2\x80\x99s the prize going to be?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHold on a minute, I got to ask all the questions first. Standard procedure, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow come you never told me you worked for \xe2\x80\x98Break Her\xe2\x80\x99? You must have known that I played,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeff asked. Again the suspicion, this time lingering on his face. I shrugged, making notes on my phone as though I was dutifully recording his answers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think the purpose of the game was? And how did you get into it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it obvious? You just got to break her. I started playing when my buddy got dumped by his ex. He paid to have her registered in the system, and I thought it would be fun to join so I could start harassing her. At first, it was just to support my buddy, but it was pretty helpful seeing where all the vulnerable chicks were. Turned out I was pretty good at it, so I decided to try and get enough points to win the prize.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cUh huh.\xe2\x80\x9d I typed as he talked. My fingers were literally shaking. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Cillia? Did you ever love her?\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a pleasant sound. A pause, then: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, are you serious? Come on, man. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a game. So what\xe2\x80\x99s the deal? Am I getting the prize today or not?\xe2\x80\x9d I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look up from my phone. I was so disgusted that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even look at him. The silence was excruciating. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this legal?\xe2\x80\x9d I breathed. Silence again, as both of us digested what I said. My cover was blown. \xe2\x80\x9cYou lying piece of shit,\xe2\x80\x9d he grunted, protectively ripping his boxes away from me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou trying to steal my points or something?\xe2\x80\x9d He was on me before I even realized what was happening. Bony arms wrapped around me, the momentum flinging me to the ground. He got a good hit to my jaw before I flipped him on his back. I was bigger and stronger than him, but he twisted under me like a feral animal. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s mine! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much work I put into that bitch!\xe2\x80\x9d he roared. I punched him to shut him up. He spit blood at me, and I hit him again. I never thought it would feel so good to hurt someone, but now that I started, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop myself. Next, I knew my hands were so soaked in blood that it ran between my knuckles like rivers. Jeff wasn\xe2\x80\x99t moving. And I was okay with that. Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s phone beeped where it lay on the ground. Somehow the weight of what I\xe2\x80\x99d just done didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit until I heard it. It beeped again, and I lifted it to see what was going on. It was a notification from \xe2\x80\x98Break Her.\xe2\x80\x99 I opened the app, and saw a short questionnaire. Humiliation, abuse, control \xe2\x80\x94 a daily checklist for him to go through to get his points. What the hell did I get myself involved in? And who was I to think I could make any difference when a whole world full of terrible people were trying to destroy her? At the bottom of the form, it asked: \xe2\x80\x98Did you see her smile today?\xe2\x80\x99 Numb and overwhelmed, I clicked yes. Immediately Cillia\xe2\x80\x99s life-bar jumped a point, up to 12/100. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s some difference at least. Not much, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a start.  "
b'\n\t\t\t\t\t17 Creepy Facts About The\xc2\xa0Lechuza\t\t\t\t',"[*] Lechuza are shape-shifting witches, according to stories told by by Mexican and Texano people. [*] A Lechuza appears to be a large bird with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face and hair. [*] In folklore, a Lechuza begins as a normal human woman who sells her soul to the devil in order to be given mystical powers and becomes a bruja. [*] Afterwards, they continue to look like normal women during the day, but at night they become Lechuza \xe2\x80\x94 with owl-like bodies and human heads. [*] At night Lechuza fly through the air or perch somewhere hidden and look for prey. [*] They make the noise of a human whistle or a crying infant in order to attract attention. [*] If you hear the sound of a Lechuza, you are not only in danger of becoming their meal \xe2\x80\x94 it is believe to be an omen that someone in your family will die. [*] Lechuza can carry a full grown man in their talons. [*] If they are especially hungry, a Lechuza will swoop down and try to run a car off the road to get to the people inside. [*] Lechuza have the power to control the weather and can make it storm. [*] They also have the power to make your vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s battery die. [*] Lechuza can not be harmed by guns or most other weapons. [*] The only thing that drives a Lechuza away is salt. You can also try screaming/cussing at it. [*] Here are a few Lechuza stories from people on Reddit who have grown up hearing them or experienced them firsthand: Story One:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGrowing up, I was told by my siblings that La Lechuza was this huge black bird that would visit your home during the night and either sit outside your window or sit on top of the roof making whistling noises until you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it anymore. Once you went outside, it would peck or scratch you.\xe2\x80\x9d Story Two: \xe2\x80\x9cThe story my grandmother told me was that Lechuzas were witches who changed their bodies into owls so that they could travel around. (Basically shapeshifters lol) She told me if I saw a lechuza (big owl) I was not to look it in the eye because if I did, it would snatch my soul at night when I slept. She also said they could be omens of death and misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d Story Three: \xe2\x80\x9cI SWEAR on my life that I saw that bird! I saw it when I was about 9 or 10. I lived south of San Antonio along 35 between 2 little towns called Von Ormy and Lytle. I was at home alone waiting for my dad to get home from work. I was on the couch watching Spongebob (which was is my favorite show). It was a bit late, the sun had set maybe an hour or so before, but the moon was full and lit everything enough that you could see like a dim light was on. My grandma\xe2\x80\x99s house was on the same plot of land about a few hundred yards in front of my house. I looked out the window because I saw movement near her back door. I thought my dad had stopped by there first and was walking home. I ran outside on the front porch to wave at him and yell hello. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my dad that I saw out there. I saw this MASSIVE bird. I mean this thing had to have been the size of big bird from sesame street (My kid memory might be exaggerating that a little, but it was huge. Much bigger than any hawk or buzzard I\xe2\x80\x99d seen before). It was sitting on the picnic table in my grandma\xe2\x80\x99s yard and it was looking dead at me. I froze, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel too scared. I was just really interested in this giant bird outside. It was jet black. All I could see was the outline of it and the eyes shining in the moonlight. I slowly went back inside and peeked at it through the window on the front door. I was so amazed by it. I had never seen anything like it. We stared at each other like this for a few minutes. Suddenly, it spread it\xe2\x80\x99s wings and flew away. I told my dad about it when he got home about an episode of Spongebob (~15 mins) later and he laughed it off, but I told my grandma the next morning while eating breakfast and she went crazy. She started saying prayers and rubbing eggs on me and stuff. Then she told me the story of La Lechuza, which I had never heard before. It sent shivers down my spine knowing that it was staring at me so intensely. After thinking about it for a few days though, I started to wonder maybe if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there to hurt me, but to warn me about something. Sure enough, a few weeks later a huge storm came through. There was a funnel cloud nearby, but it never actually touched down. The winds did do a lot of damage to my house, but my grandma\xe2\x80\x99s was completely untouched. And that picnic table was the only piece of furniture outside that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t blown away.\xe2\x80\x9d Story Four:\xe2\x80\x9cI remember [my grandmother] telling me that La Lechuza was a bruja that sold her soul to the devil and she liked to take away people who were doing \xe2\x80\x9cbad things\xe2\x80\x9d. I think my grandma was really vague because I was young and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t wanna scare me. She also told me that some people think that if you saw La Lechuza and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to chase you or hurt you, that it she was there to warn you of something bad coming.\xe2\x80\x9d Story Five:\xe2\x80\x9d I live in south Texas. I have been researching on the lechuza tonight. I was driving back to town and a huge white owl flew in front of my truck. I would say it was coincidence but this is the third time in three weeks that this has happened to me. Twice coming back from out of town and once at midnight getting out of work.I have been searching for sites on common birds to this region and The owls in this part of Texas don\xe2\x80\x99t come close to the bright white color and size of the Owls I have almost crashed into as they fly in front of my windshield. I did not believe in these Mexican urban legend, but after getting hexed in Panama I know anything is possible.\xe2\x80\x9d [*] Most people do not survive an encounter with a Lechuza, so your best bet is to run away from whistling or crying noises you hear at night, and not travel on deserted roads after dark.

b'\n\t\t\t\t\t35 Puzzling Facts About The Sodder Children\xc2\xa0Disappearance\t\t\t\t',"[*] 1n 1945, a Christmas Even fire destroyed a home in Fayetteville, West Virginia. [*] George and Jennie Sodder lived in the home with 9 of their 10 children (their oldest son, Joe, was overseas fighting in WWII). [*] That night George and Jennie Sodder were able to escape the burning house with 4 of their children. [*] The remaining 5 Sodder children were never accounted for. [*] George Sodder and Jennie Sodder were Italian immigrants who came to the US (separately) as children. George started his own trucking company in West Virginia and the two were a respected middle class family. [*] However, George had strong political opinions he expressed which some people did not like, especially in the immigrant community. (He was strongly opposed to Italian dictator Benito Mussolini).

b'\n\t\t\t\t\t17 Creepy Facts About The Black Knight Satellite Conspiracy\xc2\xa0Theory\t\t\t\t',"[*] In 1998 NASA took a photo showing an object of unknown origin that they claim is \xe2\x80\x9cspace debris\xe2\x80\x9d. [*] In the photo (above), NASA posits what you are seeing is a thermal blanket that was lost on a previous mission. This is what a thermal blanket looks like: [*] Some people believe the photo shows an alien satellite. The theory has emerged over a number of years and connects a few different pieces of bizarre data that the existence of an alien satellite would explain. Those are: [*] Radio waves we have detected in outer space as far back as 1899, long before there were human made objects in space. [*] Nikola Tesla was the first person to build a device that was capable of hearing the alien radio waves. He told a reporter: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile experimenting in Colorado\xe2\x80\xa6I obtained extraordinary experimental evidence of the existence of life on Mars. I had perfected a wireless receiver of extraordinary sensitiveness, far beyond anything known, and I caught signals which I interpreted as meaning 1\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x934. I believe the Martians used numbers for communication because numbers are universal.\xe2\x80\x9d [*] In 1954, a marine corps naval aviator, writer, and UFO research named Donald Keyhoe said that the U.S. Air Force had detected two satellites orbiting Earth. This was 3 years prior to the first human made satellite, Sputnik 1, being launched. [*] In 1960, Time reported that a satellite was engaged in a polar orbit of Earth. All known US and Russian satellites were engaged in equatorial orbit instead. The US Department of Defense responded to the article and claimed that what Time reported as a satellite was actually a broken off piece of the Discoverer satellite, not it\xe2\x80\x99s own device. No proof was offered. [*] At the time of the sighting, the technology to put a satellite into polar orbit was not yet known \xe2\x80\x94 by either the US or Russia. [*] In 1963 an American astronaut, Gordon Cooper, reported seeing a UFO while in orbit. This report is not listed in any official NASA documents. [*] At a NASA station in Australia, around 100 people also saw the UFO Cooper reported. [*] In 1973 a Scottish astronomy and science fiction author, Duncan Lunan, wrote that he had \xe2\x80\x9cidentified and deciphered a hidden radio message\xe2\x80\x9d in outer space radio emissions that predate human existence in outer space. [*] Lunan says the deciphered message said, \xe2\x80\x9cStart here. Our home is Upsilon Bootes, which is a double star. We live on the sixth planet of seven, coming from the sun, which is the larger of the two. Our sixth planet has one moon. Our fourth planet has three. Our first and third planets each have one. Our probe is in the position of Arcturus, known in our maps.\xe2\x80\x9d [*] Upsilon Bo\xc3\xb6tis is a real star in the constellation called Bo\xc3\xb6tes. [*] Lunan argued that the message originated from a planet that orbited another star in the Bo\xc3\xb6tes constellation, Epsilon Bo\xc3\xb6tis. [*] Some people believe all of these events can be explained by a non-organic, non-humanmade object called the Black Knight satellite that is believed to have been orbiting earth for 13,000 years. [*] Right now, more than 100,000 other satellites are orbiting Earth. (A satellite is any object placed intentionally into an orbit in outer space. The moon is technically a satellite, so sometimes the phrasing used is \xe2\x80\x9cartificial satellite\xe2\x80\x9d vs \xe2\x80\x9cnatural satellite\xe2\x80\x9d). The Black Knight satellite is believed to be an artificial satellite, just not one with human origins. [*] One theory suggests that the origin of the Black Knight satellite isn\xe2\x80\x99t alien but actually an ancient human creation. The idea here is that an ancient race of humans (or other intelligent, non-human animals on Earth) were scientifically advanced and launched the satellite before becoming extinct.  "
b'\n\t\t\t\t\t21 Ouija Board Rules Everyone Needs To Know Before They Start\xc2\xa0Playing\t\t\t\t',"1. Ouija boards are not a joke. Read up on what can happen when you use a ouija board before you use a ouija board. 2. The most important rule is to never taunt or goad a spirit to communicate with you through the Ouija board. This can have disastrous consequences. 3. Never ask a Ouija board when you are going to die. 4. Spirits who talk to you through your Ouija board can tell you anything they want. Just because a spirit says something does not mean it is true. A spirit try to win your trust by telling you they are a long lost relative or the spirit of a small child who needs your help. In reality, the spirit could be malevolent. 5. Never use a Ouija board alone. The more people with you when using a Ouija board, the better. This means there is more energy present to connect with a spirit. If not everyone can comfortably sit and touch the planchette, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine to have some people just be viewers. 6. Do not use a Ouija board in your home. If you do connect with a malevolent spirit, the energy will be in your home and it will be harder to break contact. 7. One person in the group should be the leader. This is the person who will talk and ask questions while the group is using the board. 8. If you are using the Ouija board and are not the \xe2\x80\x9cleader\xe2\x80\x9d, you should keep your fingers on the planchette and remain silent. No one should laugh or ask whether it is \xe2\x80\x9cworking\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 this is negative energy which interferes with the process! Try not to decipher the words as the planchette moves. Your role is to close your eyes and focus your energy on the planchette. 9. The leader should not ask joke questions!!! 10. One person should be assigned the task of keeping track of the answers. They can write down the letters/words on a notepad and translate to the group what they think the spirit is saying. Try not to guess what the answers are in the moment. Write down what is happening and do that after the planchette stops moving. 11. Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave the planchette on the board. When you are done using your ouija board, remove the planchette from the board. Even if you are just leaving the room for a bit, it\xe2\x80\x99s considered bad luck to leave the planchette on the board. 12. If you want to take a break, have one person keep their hand on the planchette to stay connected to the energy you\xe2\x80\x99ve built. 13. Always end your session with the Ouija board by saying \xe2\x80\x9cgoodbye\xe2\x80\x9d. 14. The location you use should be (ideally) dark and free of background noise. You can use a candle to light the board enough to see what the planchette may be spelling. 15. If a spirit starts communicating with you through the board by counting down or going through the alphabet, immediately end the session by saying \xe2\x80\x9cgoodbye\xe2\x80\x9d. This is a common theme in ouija users who have contacted a malevolent spirit that is trying to leave the board. 16. If a spirit starts communicating with you by making the planchette make a figure 8 or infinity symbol, immediately end the session by saying \xe2\x80\x9cgoodbye\xe2\x80\x9d. This is another way malevolent spirits have revealed themselves. 17. If you begin to suspect that you are in contact with a malevolent spirit, immediately end the session by putting the planchette on \xe2\x80\x9cgoodbye\xe2\x80\x9d. It also helps to leave the physical space you are in to sever the energy between the group and the spirit. 18. If you speak to a spirit who identifies themselves as \xe2\x80\x9cZozo\xe2\x80\x9d, end the session and say \xe2\x80\x9cgoodbye\xe2\x80\x9d immediately. Zozo has been identified as a malevolent spirit. 19. Don\xe2\x80\x99t use a Ouija board in a cemetery. 20. If you are experiencing depression, it may be good to avoid using a Ouija board. That kind of energy draws in malevolent spirits. 21. Never burn a Ouija board. This can do more damage than simply leaving it untouched in a closet. If you are having problems with a ouija board, store the planchette and board separately.  "
"b'\n\t\t\t\t\tI Got A Creepy Letter From The Person Who Used To Live In My House, And I Can\xe2\x80\x99t Help But Wonder If What They Wrote Is\xc2\xa0True\t\t\t\t'","I am so thankful that summer is finally here, but this morning I was kind of surprised when I looked at the calendar and saw that it was already May. April flew by, but thankfully it took the last of the chilly weather with it. As I put my daughter down for her nap, I start to cover her up with an old baby blanket that my grandmother had made for me when I was a baby. Something about those hand-stitched roses lining the edges of the fabric feel like home, reminding me of summers of my childhood spent sitting on her living room floor, watching her hands work magic with that thread and needle. I quickly decide against using the blanket on my daughter as I wipe a bead of sweat off of my own temple with the back of my hand. Instead, I fold the blanket neatly and hang it over the railing at the foot of her crib. I turn and pull one of my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s old wall decorations out of the box on the floor and reach up to hang it on the nail on the wall across from where my daughter is now sleeping. I pull the newly-hung curtains to the side to allow a fresh summer breeze to come in through the window, carrying the scent of the former resident\xe2\x80\x99s rose bushes in with it. While doing this, I notice the mail lady coming up the sidewalk. I tiptoe out of my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s room and run to the door to greet her on the porch. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got something for me?\xe2\x80\x9d I ask, unable to keep the excitement out of my voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYes Ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d She says, handing me a plain-looking envelope. I accidentally snatch the envelope out of her hand and then apologize immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little excited. This is the first piece of mail that I\xe2\x80\x99ve received at this new address. I just moved in a couple of days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d The mail lady smiles patiently. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand. Have a nice day.\xe2\x80\x9d She turns and walks toward the next house. Feeling like a little kid opening their first present on Christmas morning, I start to tear open the envelope but stop as I notice that my address is scrawled in unfamiliar handwriting on the front. This excites me, even more, when I realize that my very first piece of mail might actually be a handwritten letter. The \xe2\x80\x9cWe Just Got A Letter\xe2\x80\x9d tune from Blue\xe2\x80\x99s Clues pops into my head as I sit down and tear the rest of the envelope off, to reveal a few pieces of notebook paper covered front to back with small handwriting in blue ink. Anxiously, I begin to read: Hello, You don\xe2\x80\x99t know me. Perhaps this is silly, but I feel an obligation to you that I write this. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking of you a lot for the past couple weeks, and there are some things that I think you need to know. If I were you, I would want to know. I shift uncomfortably on the cement step of my front porch. I used to live in your house. I grew up there, from 1993 until December of 2010. I drive by your house often, seeing as I take the main road to get to where I need to go. I suppose in a typical situation when a person drives by an old place from their past, their automatic instinct would be to turn their head and take a quick glance at the site where they spent so much of their childhood growing up. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the case with me. When I drive past 17201, my eyes don\xe2\x80\x99t flinch from the road in front of me. However, on the few occasions when I force myself to glance at the house, I immediately feel something staring back at me, every single time. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if the home has a pair of eyes of its own, and they recognize me, too.  Like I said, there are some things that you need to know. \xe2\x80\x9cWho would write such a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d I wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why would they want to make me feel uncomfortable here?\xe2\x80\x9d In 1990, when my parents and sister (who was roughly a year old at the time) first started moving their stuff into the house, my mom noticed that crucifixes were hanging above every window and doorway inside. In a way, she found comfort in seeing them. My mother said that they made her feel safe, but my dad thought they were a little weird. Within the first few months of them living there, my mom noticed that one by one, the crosses started to disappear. She assumed that it was my dad who had been taking them down discretely because they had been making him uncomfortable. She thought it was sweet of my father to sort of take his time doing it like he was trying to be nice about it and ease the crosses away from her one at a time, so she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be offended by their sudden absence.  One day, after the crosses had all been removed, my dad asked her where she had put them because he had favored one particular cross that had been hanging above the window in their bedroom. Of course, this upset my mother because she thought he was teasing her. Once she realized that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, they actually searched the house for the crosses, thinking some of them might have just fallen off the wall and landed on a bed or behind the couch or something. They never did find them. Without realizing it, I look away from the letter and walk to my car to grab my pack of cigarettes from the glove compartment. I place one between my lips with shaking fingers. Why are my fingers trembling? After I was born, my sister and I shared the master bedroom. There would be nights when our mom would carry us to bed after we had fallen asleep on the couch and the phone would ring, or something would distract her, and she would leave the room. A few moments later, she would remember that she had forgotten to tuck us in, or that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t covered us up at all. She would return to our bedroom and stop in the doorway, confused to see that the blankets were already covering us, neatly tucked in under and around us while we were sound asleep.  My mother viewed whatever might have been in that house as harmless, or even protective, until a few years later when my sister would cry inconsolably until our mom would let us sleep in the living room. My sister would always say how she felt ill in our room like there was something bad in there. Growing up, we would spend our summers and weekends sleeping on the couch rather than in our own beds. When I was 7, my mom said she woke up in the middle of the night because she heard one of us crying and call out for her from our bedroom. Still half asleep, she got up and went into our bedroom and turned on the light, only to give herself a mini panic attack at the sight of an empty room, before remembering that my sister and I were actually on the other side of the country in Oregon visiting our uncle at that time. We were always seeing and hearing strange things in that house. When any of us would sit in the recliner in the living room and watch TV, we would often see tall, dark shadow figures in the hallway, out of the corner of our eye. Eventually, we all just stopped sitting in that chair and started sitting on the couch or the floor so we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see into the hallway. There was a day when we were cooking dinner, and my dad just barged into the kitchen, demanding to know if any of us had just been in the hallway. We all just kind of looked at him like he was crazy, and he explained that he had just seen someone walk down the hallway and into our bedroom. He was worried that someone had broken in and been hiding in the house. Of course, neither he nor his baseball bat found anyone upon further investigation. Whenever our cousins or friends would sleepover, we would all take turns between sleeping on the couches or on the living room floor. Our guests who were sleeping on the floor would often wake us up, scared because they heard weird noises in the basement under them. A lot of strange things happened in that basement. At one point, our cousin moved in with us, making a room down there. During his second week of staying there, he was awoken by the sound of humming and rustling bags. He started talking to my mom, assuming that the noises he was hearing were just her going through bags of dirty clothes and doing the laundry. When she didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond, he got up and walked to the other side of the basement to the washing machine, only to discover that he was alone in the basement. When I was in middle school, I remember heading into the basement to toss some dirty clothes into a basket by the washer. When I got to the stairs, I froze. I looked up just in time to see the head and shoulder of a dark figure peek out from behind the furnace in the middle of the basement. Naturally, I dropped my clothes and ran like hell. From that day until the day that we moved out, I refused to go into that basement. My mom was often afraid to go in the basement alone, so she would make my dad go with her. This strange phenomenon continued into my high school years. During my junior year of high school, I used to wake up at 5 in the morning, an hour before everyone else in the house so I could have the bathroom to myself to get ready for school. While doing this, I would usually listen to music through my headphones to help wake myself up. One particular morning when I was getting ready in front of the mirror, I started hearing a strange background noise that I knew wasn\xe2\x80\x99t part of the music. I took my headphones out to see where the noise was coming from. At first, I thought the toilet was overflowing, but then I pulled back the shower curtain and discovered that the faucet in the bathtub had been turned on full pressure. Everyone else was asleep, and the knobs in the bathtub were really hard to turn. I struggled to turn the knob with both hands to shut the water off. By the time I finished applying my mascara that morning, I had convinced myself that it never happened. I mean, if whatever had the strength to turn on the old faucet in the bathtub, what else did it have the strength to do? Luckily, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t live in that house long enough to find out. A couple months later, a week after my 17th birthday, we moved out. I apologize for the length of this letter, but I assure you that this is just a brief summary of all of the strange things that have happened there in that house. At this point, you probably think that I am crazy. Or maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Maybe there is a reason why you read this letter to the very end. Maybe you have experienced some unexplainable things for yourself. Well, I am here to assure you that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all in your head. Anything that you have seen or felt was very real. I also wanted to write you this letter because I have heard that the reconstruction or redecoration of any building can often trigger the activity of whatever might still be residing within it. Just know that you are not alone.\xc2\xa0 Please\xc2\xa0be careful. I will continue to pray for you. After reading the letter, I continue to sit on the front porch step. I stare at the traffic on the road in front of me and watch as the cars go back and forth in a hypnotic manner. I look at the pile of cigarette butts on the sidewalk in front of me and laugh out loud. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t smoked this many cigarettes at one time since I was 18 years old. I am reluctant to admit that the letter definitely had me going there for a minute, but the person who took the time to write something so long and ridiculous to a stranger must have been bored, not to mention crazy. Too bad I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in that stuff. I laugh again as I get up and go into the house to grab a water out of the fridge. I crumple up the letter and toss it into the trash can under the kitchen sink. Just as I head to the living room to sit on the couch, I hear my daughter giggling in her room. How is she awake already? I grunt, then head to check in on her. In her doorway, I freeze. In her crib, I find my daughter laughing, cozily tucked in under my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s blanket, and pointing at the wall on the other side of the room. I turn my head and look. The wall is bare. Where did my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s crucifix go?  "
